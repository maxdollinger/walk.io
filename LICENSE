Notice

The Business Source License (this document, or the "License") sets forth the
terms and conditions under which the Licensor makes the Licensed Work available
and may only be complied with if you have the prior written consent of the
Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this is not an open source license. If you
have an open source license concern, please contact the Licensor.

Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, and distribute the
Licensed Work, subject to the following conditions:

1. You may not sell the Licensed Work, or offer it as part of a service or
   product that is sold for revenue, unless you first obtain a commercial
   license from the Licensor.

2. You may use the Licensed Work for internal business purposes, including
   running it on your own servers and infrastructure.

3. You may modify the Licensed Work and use the modified version, provided you
   maintain this License with the modified code.

4. You must retain, in the source code of any modified versions of the Licensed
   Work that you distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
   notices from the original Licensed Work (excluding those notices that do not
   pertain to any part of the derivative works).

5. If the Licensed Work, or a portion of it, becomes available under a different
   license (such as the MIT License on the Change Date), you may use it under
   the terms of that license going forward.
